<h2 align="left">History</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
University of Poona was established on 10 February 1949 under the Poona University Act, passed by the Bombay legislature in 1948. M. R. Jayakar became its first Vice-Chancellor. After the declaration of the formation of University of Poona in 1948 and the subsequent declaration of Jayakar as the first vice-chancellor of varsity, its first office was started from the Nizam Guest House, which is the part of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute on Law College Road. The university was operated at Nizam Guest House till 1 June 1949. Later it was shifted to the current building, which was originally called the Governor House. As its name suggests, it was the seasonal retreat of the Governor of Bombay.

B. G. Kher, Chief Minister and Education Minister of the government of Bombay, helped ensure the university received a large allocation of land for their campus. The university was allocated over 411 acres (1.66 km²).

Its location has historical significance. Some incidents of the Battle of Khirkee, during the Third Anglo-Maratha War, took place where the present-day university is located. The present-day main building was built in 1864 and was known as the Governor's House.[citation needed]

The institution's name was changed from the University of Pune to Savitribai Phule Pune University on 9 August 2014 in honor of Savitribai Phule, the 19th century Indian social reformer who played an important role in improving the lives of women and the Dalit communities in Maharashtra during British colonial rule. She and her husband Mahatma Jyotirao Phule founded India's first native run school for girls in 1848.

<h2 align="left">Jurisdiction</h2>

<p>
Initially the university had a jurisdiction extending over 12 districts of western Maharashtra. With the establishment of Shivaji University in Kolhapur in 1962, the jurisdiction was restricted to five districts: Pune, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Dhule and Jalgaon. Out of these, two districts—Dhule and Jalgaon—are attached to the North Maharashtra University in Jalgaon established in August 1990.
